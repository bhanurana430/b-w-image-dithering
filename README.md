**B&W Dithering Editor**

This Python code provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for applying black and white dithering to images. 

**Features**

* Supports a variety of image formats including PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, and TIFF.
* Allows selection between threshold and random dithering algorithms.
* Enables users to define a custom threshold value.
* Displays both the original and dithered versions of the image.
* Provides the ability to save the dithered image as a TIFF file.

**Requirements**

* Python 3.x
* tkinter library
* Pillow (PIL Fork) library
* numpy library

**Installation**

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install tkinter Pillow numpy
```

**Usage**

1. Save the Python script as `bw_dithering_editor.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python bw_dithering_editor.py
```

**GUI Description**

The GUI consists of several elements:

* **Image Path:** Enter the path to the image file you want to dither or use the "Browse" button to select a file.
* **Algorithm:** Select the desired dithering algorithm from the dropdown menu (Threshold or Random).
* **Threshold:** This option is only applicable for the threshold dithering algorithm and allows you to specify a custom threshold value. 
* **Generate:** Click this button to apply the selected dithering algorithm to the image.
* **Save Dithered Image:** Click this button to save the dithered image as a TIFF file.
* **Image Display:** The GUI displays both the original and dithered versions of the image.

**Additional Notes**

* The code resizes the displayed images to fit within a maximum width and height of 200 pixels.
* The threshold value must be between 0 and 255 (inclusive).
